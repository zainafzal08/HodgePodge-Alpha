The glyph can cover\nan area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is\nmoved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is\nbroken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs\ninscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or\nstanding on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,\napproaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the\nobject on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an\nobject, the most common triggers include opening that object,\napproaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or\nreading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under\ncertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as\nheight or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to\naffect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions\nfor creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\n**Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical\nenergy in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere\nspreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity\nsaving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or\nthunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create\nthe glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n**Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower\nin the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell\nmust target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no\nimmediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered,\nthe stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the\ncreature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the\narea is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile\ncreatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as\npossible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires\nconcentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of\n4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases\nby 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you\ncan store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the\nglyph of warding.", "classes": "Cleric, Wizard, Bard"}, {"name": "Wall of Water", "concentration": "Requires Concentration", "page": "@ ee Page 23 and xge Page 170", "range": "60 feet", "components": "(V)(S)(M)", "ritual": "Is a Ritual", "duration": "10 minutes", "level": 3, "castingTime": "1 action", "school": "Evocation", "description": "You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range.
